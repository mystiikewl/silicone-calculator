# Joint Profile Specifications

This document provides detailed specifications for different joint profiles used in silicone sealant applications.

## Square Joint 

Standard profile with width twice the depth, providing optimal balance between movement capability and material usage.

### Specifications
- **Width-to-Depth Ratio**: 2:1
- **Width Range**: 6mm - 24mm
- **Depth Range**: 6mm - 12mm
- **Tolerance**: ±20%

### Usage Guidelines
- Most common profile type.
- Use backing rod if depth exceeds 10mm.
- Ideal for general sealing applications.
- Good movement capability.

## Deep Joint

Profile with equal width and depth, suitable for joints requiring good depth but with limited width.

### Specifications
- **Width-to-Depth Ratio**: 1:1
- **Width Range**: 6mm - 12mm
- **Depth Range**: 6mm - 12mm
- **Tolerance**: ±20%

### Usage Guidelines
- Always use backing rod.
- Ideal for narrow joints requiring good depth.
- Suitable for joints with high movement.
- Provides excellent adhesion surface.

## Wide Joint

Wide profile with width greater than twice the depth, suitable for larger gaps.

### Specifications
- **Width-to-Depth Ratio**: 2:1
- **Width Range**: 25mm - 50mm+
- **Depth Range**: 6mm - 12mm
- **Tolerance**: ±30%

### Usage Guidelines
- May require multiple application passes.
- Depth should not exceed half the width for proper adhesion.
- Consider using backer rod.
- Monitor material settling.

## V-Joint

V-shaped profile commonly used in corner applications and angular joints.

### Specifications
- **Width-to-Depth Ratio**: 1.5:1
- **Width Range**: 6mm - 20mm
- **Depth Range**: 6mm - 12mm
- **Tolerance**: ±25%
- **Special Note**: Volume calculation uses triangular cross-section formula.

### Usage Guidelines
- Ideal for corner applications.
- Good for joints with angular movement.
- Volume is approximately half of a square joint.
- Tooling is critical for proper shape formation.

### Volume Calculation
Due to the triangular profile:
- Actual volume = (Width × Depth × Length) ÷ 2
- Account for approximately 50% less material compared to square joints.

## U-Joint

U-shaped profile suitable for joints requiring rounded edges and enhanced movement capability.

### Specifications
- **Width-to-Depth Ratio**: 1.5:1
- **Width Range**: 8mm - 24mm
- **Depth Range**: 8mm - 15mm
- **Tolerance**: ±25%
- **Special Note**: Requires special tooling for U-shape formation.

### Usage Guidelines
- Suitable for expansion joints.
- Excellent for accommodating multi-directional movement.
- Requires proper tooling for U-shape.
- Consider using specialized application tools.

### Installation Notes
- Use appropriate backing material.
- Tool to achieve uniform U-shape.
- Ensure proper depth for movement capability.
- May require specialized application nozzle.

## Application Notes

1. **Measuring**
   - Always measure at multiple points along the joint.
   - Use appropriate measuring tools.
   - Consider joint movement range.

2. **Surface Preparation**
   - Clean surfaces thoroughly.
   - Remove loose materials.
   - Use appropriate primers if needed.

3. **Installation**
   - Install backing rod when required.
   - Apply sealant in continuous motion.
   - Tool immediately after application.

4. **Common Issues**
   - Three-sided adhesion (avoid).
   - Improper depth control.
   - Insufficient surface preparation.
   - Incorrect width-to-depth ratio. Refer to the individual joint profile specifications for the correct width-to-depth ratios.

5. **Volume Considerations**
   - Square/Wide/Deep Joints: Volume = Width × Depth × Length
   - V-Joints: Volume = (Width × Depth × Length) ÷ 2
   - U-Joints: Consider additional material for curved profile.

## Joint Ratio Examples

Here are examples of correct and incorrect joint ratios for each profile:

**Square Joint (2:1)**
| Correct Ratio | Incorrect Ratio |
|---|---|
| 12mm wide x 6mm deep | 10mm wide x 10mm deep | 
| 20mm wide x 10mm deep | 30mm wide x 10mm deep | 

**Wide Joint (2:1)**
| Correct Ratio | Incorrect Ratio |
|---|---|
| 30mm wide x 12mm deep | 30mm wide x 20mm deep |
| 40mm wide x 12mm deep | 50mm wide x 10mm deep | 

**Deep Joint (1:1)**
| Correct Ratio | Incorrect Ratio |
|---|---|
| 20mm wide x 20mm deep | 10mm wide x 20mm deep | 
| 15mm wide x 18mm deep | 30mm wide x 40mm deep | 

**V-Joint (1.5:1)** 
| Correct Ratio | Incorrect Ratio |
|---|---|
| 15mm wide x 10mm deep | 10mm wide x 10mm deep |
| 20mm wide x 12mm deep | 30mm wide x 10mm deep | 

**U-Joint (1.5:1)** 
*Due to the complexity of U-shaped joints, specific dimension recommendations are highly application-specific.*
